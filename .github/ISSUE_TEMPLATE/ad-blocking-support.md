## Please provide a screenshot of the ad or content that you think should be blocked. No support will be given until one is provided.

Ads are blocked based on a combination CSS selectors and text strings or regex patterns. Typically, all you need to provide is an example of the ad in a screenshot and I will be able to verify and add a rule to the list. If possible, it would also help if you are able to add a custom rule under the advanced options and provide a screenshot verifying it works. If unsure, a reliable, but slow, selector to use would be `div,span,a`

Facebook doesn't give every person the same version of code that displays the site. They do this for various reasons, such as testing new features on just some users before rolling them out to everyone, or for some content that is only available in certain countries.
Because of this, what works for me, may not work for you. Since I am only able to work with what Facebook gives me personally, there is no way for me to investigate other users' issues that aren't also present for me.
It's possible that if you wait for a little while, I might start getting the same version as you, and will be able to fix the problem on my own. Otherwise, the only way to find the solution is if you do so yourself.
